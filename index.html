      Since I arrived to this country in 2005, my dream has been to have fame. Yes, fame, not the Chris Brown, or Justin Beiber kind of fame, but the one that is trascendental. The fame and recognizition of people like Le Corbusier, or Frank Lloyd Wright, the fame of a real artist that leaves a legacy behind.

      I love to be busy, I love to create, and I cannot live a minute of my life standing still, I vibrate with the core of the earth. This impatient rush that I walk with shakes ideas in my head, and brews solutions for commercial problems, copywriter needs, customer satisfaction and most of all, new doors to better projects.

      I always try to do things that impress people and make them smile, out of wonder, mystery, confusion, or just humor. My main goal is to pull out an emotion from you with my bare pencils, to inspire and motivate; but most of all, to show my 1 year old daughter that if she can dream it, she can have it!
