<h1> About Lucho </h1>
<p> <h2> Colombian Brewed, Miami Infused</h2>

<p>My name is Luis G Escobar, but since my dad has the same name, everyone calls me Lucho. 
I was born in Colombia, in 1991, and lived there until 2005 when I moved from Bogota to Miami, Fl.
I went to Coral Gables Sr High School and Graduated with an APID and went on with my education at
Miami Dade College - Wolfson Campus. I graduated MDC with an Associate Degree and went on to Florida
International University to pursue my Bachelors in Art History. After a reality check in my life,
I realized that I was meant to create and design graphics</html>
