  <p> <h2> Colombian Brewed, Miami Infused</h2>

  <p>My name is Luis G Escobar, but since my dad has the same name, everyone calls me Lucho. 
  I was born in Colombia, in 1991, and lived there until 2005 when I moved from Bogota to Miami, Fl.
  I went to Coral Gables Sr High School and Graduated with an APID and went on with my education at
  Miami Dade College - Wolfson Campus. I graduated MDC with an Associate Degree and went on to Florida
  International University to pursue my Bachelors in Art History. After a reality check in my life,
  I realized that I was meant to create and design graphics. In December of 2014 my daughter Alice Marie 
  was born and my life changed, I started studying at Miami International University of Art and Design
